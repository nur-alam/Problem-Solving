Problem 10:

Write a recursive solution to compute lcm of two integers. You must not use the formula lcm(a,b) = (a x b) / gcd(a,b); find lcm from scratch...

Input:
23 488
Output:
11224

Solution for problem 10:
Finding lcm in "bangla method" is actually easy. Keep multiplying one number a, with i starting from 1 and whenever, a*i is divisible by the other number b, a*i is the lcm.
[.c]
#include <stdio.h>

int lcm(int a, int b, int m)
{
    if(a*m % b == 0) return a*m;
    return lcm(a, b, m+1);
}

int main()
{
    int a, b, l;
    scanf("%d %d", &a, &b);
    l = lcm(a, b, 1);
    printf("%d\n", l);
    return 0;
}
[.c]


You can also do it by multiplying m with b and checking divisibility by a. This process is not good though, but if we want to follow recursion, we need to do this.
