Problem 5:

Write a recursive solution to evaluate the previous polynomial for any given x and n.
Like, when x=2 and n=5, we have 1 + x + x2 + ................. + xn-1 = 31

Input:
2 5
Output:
31

Solution for problem 5:
Well, this is same as the previous one, instead of printing it, you need to evaluate it for given n and x. So the recursive formula for this may be: f(x, n) = x^n + f(x, n-1). In programming, we can easily do this recursively in forward order.

#include <stdio.h>
#include <math.h>

int sum_poly(int i, int n, int x)
{
    if(n==0)
        return 1;
    if(i<n)
        return (int)pow(x,i) + sum_poly(i+1, n, x);
    return 0;
}

int main()
{
    int n, v, x;
    scanf("%d %d", &x, &n);
    v = sum_poly(0, n, x);
    printf("%d\n", v);
    return 0;
}


Try with some other series you might imagine.
