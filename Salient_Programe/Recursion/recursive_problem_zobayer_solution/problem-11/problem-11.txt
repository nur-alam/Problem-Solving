Problem 11:

Suppose you are given an array of integers in an arbitrary order. Write a recursive solution to find the maximum element from the array.

Input:
5
7 4 9 6 2
Output: 9

Solution for problem 11:
First, lets formulate the problem recursively. Say an array of n integers is given. Then we can say, Max(i) will return the maximum element from positions i to the end of the array, i.e. in range [ai,....,an]. So, Max(i) will be the maximum of ith position and Max(i+1). We'll write: Max(i) = maximum( A[i], Max(i+1) ).
[.c]
#include <stdio.h>

int Max(int i, int n, int *a)
{
    int m;
    if(i==n-1) return a[i]; // the last value is the maximum for this step
    m = Max(i+1, n, a);
    return ((a[i] > m)? a[i] : m);
}

int main()
{
    int n, i, m, a[100];
    scanf("%d", &n);
    for(i=0; i<n; i++)
        scanf("%d", &a[i]);
    m = Max(0, n, a);
    printf("%d\n", m);
    return 0;
}
[.c]


You may try to find the minimum number. Can be done in the similar fashion.
